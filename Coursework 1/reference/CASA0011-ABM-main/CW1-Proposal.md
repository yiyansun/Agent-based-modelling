# 3 Brief description of inspirational academic paper

## Intro

This inspirational paper is organized as follows. 

Section 2 describes the theoretical foundation of
blockchain-enabled P2P energy trading and the use of ABM to simulate the integration of renewables in smart grids. 

Section 3 characterizes the case study of Perth, Western Australia and the trial of P2P energy trading in the Fremantle residential neighborhood. 

Section 4 describes the ABM of the electricity market to simulate decentralized P2P energy trades and its implementation using the multi-agent simulator of neighborhoods (MASON) open-source toolkit [21].. 

Section 5 explains the modeling scenarios simulated in the study. 

Section 6 lists a set of results from the analysis of alternative electricity market structures, the use of storage, and the clustering of trial participants. 

Section 7 provides a discussion of the impact of governance structures on the dynamics of P2P energy systems and the scale at which they are most effectively managed. 

Finally, Section 8 presents the conclusions of our study.

The ABM is developed using data about 18 consumer and prosumer households that participated in a P2P market trial. Data describing energy **consumption** profiles, energy **generation** profiles, and **willingness-to-accept** and **willingness-to-pay** values for excess solar generated power are used as input for the ABM.

# 4 Explanation of value of research question with reference to paper

This article makes several contributions at the interface of P2P energy trading and ABM research. We contribute to the burgeoning literature on P2P energy trading by analyzing the dynamics arising from the interactions of heterogeneous pro- and consumers with an empirically tested pricing structure and trading mechanism. To the authors’ knowledge, this is the first post-hoc agent-based study of a real-life P2P energy trading trial. Methodologically, we thereby address the lack of empirical data for modelling and validation in ABM studies by presenting a framework and simulation based on a real-world trial. Using available data, real consumption and generation data was used to run the simulation, and simulation results were validated against observed dynamics. Finally, the validated ABM was used to assess alternative market structures in the context of the case study.

# 5 Explanation of why ABM is an appropriate tool for the question

The complex, dynamic nature of energy systems has made simulation studies and ABM in particular, a viable approach in the study of emerging energy system structures. ABM has the ability to account for the complexity of interactions in real-world settings [29]. This makes it uniquely suited to simulating energy systems [30,31] and an important tool for the management of power systems [16]. Using ABM, dynamic processes and their emergent properties can be simulated effectively based on interactions among heterogeneous, autonomous agents. ABM is applicable for emerging P2P markets that are formed through interactions between rational and distributed decision-making units [16,17]. 



 We use an agent-based modelling (ABM) approach to simulate **consumer and prosumer agents** that enter the market equipped with storage solutions, forecasting algorithms, and willingness-to-buy and accept values.

## Title / working title of the research

An initial idea of the title should be given - this is likely to be revised as the research progresses and can therefore be a tentative suggestion at the proposal stage.

## Introduction

The context and background of the research topic / issue, as well as the rationale for undertaking the research, should be outlined in the introduction section. Reference to key literature should be included to strengthen the rationale for conducting the research. This will enable the reader to understand what the research will be about and why it is important.  

At the end of the introduction, include an outline (or synopsis) of how the proposal is organised.

## Literature review

This should expand on the key literature referred to in the introduction. The review of the literature will need to go further than listing individual studies or theories. You will need to demonstrate an awareness of the current state of knowledge and an understanding of key lines of argument and debates on the topic / issue.  

The literature will need to be critically analysed and evaluated rather than just described. This means demonstrating how studies, arguments and debates are linked and how the existing body of research links to your own research area / issue.

## Research aims and questions

The research aims and research questions should be used to guide your research.  
The aims of the research relate to the purpose of conducting the research and what you specifically want to achieve. The research questions should be formulated to show how you will achieve the aims of the research and what you want to find out.  

The research aims and questions can either be stated at the end of the introduction (before the outline of the proposal) or after the literature review - guidance from your department / funding body may specify this.

## Methodology

The methodology section of the proposal should outline how the research will be conducted. This should generally include a description and justification of: sample / participants, methods, data collection and analysis, and ethical considerations.  

To justify the chosen methodology, you can refer to recommended reading for research methods as well as previous studies conducted on your chosen topic.

## Ethics

Including a detailed discussion of the ethics of your research project can really strengthen the proposal. It forces you to think in very practical and detailed terms about what you are planning to do.  

## Timescale

You may be required to include a schedule or plan of how you intend to conduct the research within a specified timeframe. This can be presented in a variety of ways but should generally include specific milestones (e.g. collection of data, analysis of findings) and intended completion dates.

## Reference list

The reference list should include all sources cited in the research proposal. Departmental guidelines for referencing should be followed for in-text citations and the reference list.
