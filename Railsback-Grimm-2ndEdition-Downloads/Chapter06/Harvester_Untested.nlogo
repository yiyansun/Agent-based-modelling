# HARVESTER MODEL
Model formulated and implemented by S. F. Railsback and V. Grimm

This model is loosely based on the model of:
Pérez, I., & Janssen, M. A. 2015. The effect of spatial heterogeneity and mobility on the performance of social–ecological systems. Ecological Modelling, 296, 1–11.

However, this model is different from the model of Pérez & Janssen in important ways and should not be compared to, or treated as equivalent to, their model.

This NetLogo implementation intentionally includes programming errors as a software testing exercise!! This program is completely independent of the software used by Pérez & Janssen.

# MODEL DESCRIPTION (ODD FORMAT)
## PURPOSE
This model is derived from the model of Pérez and Janssen (2015), but is simplified and focused on a different purpose. The model addresses the general issue of cooperative vs. selfish behavior in social systems. Natural selection is believed to be driven mainly by selfishness (“survival of the fittest”), yet cooperative societies often offer higher overall success to their members. Selfish individuals are likely to be even more successful when competing in a society of mostly unselfish individuals, compared to competing with other selfish individuals. How can cooperative behavior persist in competition with selfishness? One answer is via punishment: if selfish individuals are sometimes caught and fined for using more resources than cooperative individuals, they may lose enough of their advantage to allow the cooperative individuals to persist. This model is designed to explore how punishment affects co-existence of cooperative and selfish individuals, in a very simple system that loosely resembles an agricultural society. It also explores the interacting effect of landscape structure—how the resources harvested by the individuals are distributed over space. Example analyses the model can address are: (a) How does the risk of punishment affect overall abundance and harvest by cooperative and selfish harvesters? (b) How does the risk of punishment affect the average level of “greediness” in selfish harvesters? (c) How do the answers to (a) and (b) depend on the level of spatial variability in resource availability?

## ENTITIES, STATE VARIABLES, AND SCALES
The model represents space as a two-dimensional landscape made up of square patches. These patches can be thought of as small regions or villages within which resources are produced and shared by the harvesters that occupy the patch. The landscape is made up of 50 × 50 patches; distance units and patch size are arbitrary. 

Time is represented as steps that represent the time within which resources are produced and consumed; one time step can be thought of as a year with its resource growth and harvest cycle and one cycle of harvester reproduction. Simulations have a standard duration of 1000 time steps.

### Patches
Patches have two state variables. _Resource_ is a dynamic variable representing the amount of resource currently available for harvest, in arbitrary energy units. _Max-resource_ is a static variable that varies among patches and is the maximum value that resource approaches if there is no harvest for many time steps. The resource growth submodel uses _max-resource_ in updating the value of _resource_.

### Harvesters
Harvesters are the agents that consume resources and potentially move among patches. Their state variables describe their location, their behavior, and their energy state. Location is tracked as the patch occupied by a harvester. The variable _behavior-type_ has a value of either “cooperative” or “selfish”, distinguishing these two types of harvesters. Harvesters of type “selfish” have a static state variable _greediness_ that represents how much resource they attempt to harvest and need to be satisfied. The value of _greediness_ is between zero and one. The dynamic variable _energy_ is the harvester’s current energy state, in the same energy units as _resource_. _Harvest_ is a variable used only to record how much resource was harvested in the current time step.


## PROCESS OVERVIEW AND SCHEDULING
The following actions are executed on each time step. The order in which harvesters execute each action is randomized each time step, to represent the lack of a hierarchy.
  1.	Patches grow resource, regenerating the material that harvesters consume (the resource growth submodel, detailed below). The rate at which patches grow more resource varies nonlinearly with amount that resource has been depleted below its maximum level, so that the maximum rate of resource growth (and, therefore, harvest) is at an intermediate level of harvest (explained in the harvest submodel).
  2.	Harvesters harvest resource (the harvest submodel). There are usually many more harvesters than patches, so harvesters can either share or compete with the other harvesters on their patch. The cooperative harvesters share: each consumes an amount that would maximize long-term harvest if all harvesters on the patch took that same amount. The selfish harvesters compete: each tries to consume an amount greater than cooperative harvesters do, with that amount depending on their selfishness variable.
  3.	Selfish harvesters are subjected to potential punishment, a “fine” that takes away some of their energy (the punishment submodel).
  4.	Harvesters move to a new patch if they are dissatisfied with their harvest (the resettlement submodel). 
  5.	Harvesters die if their energy is completely consumed (the death submodel).
  6.	Harvesters reproduce, producing at most one new harvester of the same type (the reproduction submodel). The probability of reproducing increases with the harvester’s value of energy.
  7.	Model outputs (the “Observation” design concept) are updated.


## DESIGN CONCEPTS
_Basic principles_: This model addresses two important concepts of social science: the evolution of cooperation and management of shared (“common-pool”) resources. How cooperative behavior can arise and persist in a society of selfish individuals has been the subject of numerous models, many using the “prisoner’s dilemma” game as a framework (e.g., Axelrod, R. 1984. The evolution of cooperation. Basic Books, New York NY). This model addresses this question in the framework of shared harvest or shared use of common resources. How social groups can share common resources to their mutual benefit and avoid the “tragedy of the commons” (Lloyd, W. F. 1833. Two lectures on the checks to population. Oxford University Press, Oxford, England, 1833, reprinted in part in Population, evolution, and birth control, G. Hardin, Ed., Freeman, San Francisco, 1964) has also been extensively studied and modeled, prominently in the work of Elinor Ostrom. In this model, “cooperative” harvesters consume a resource at its maximum sustainable rate, so the system is expected to be most productive when all harvesters are cooperative. However, the system also has “selfish” harvesters that can consume more than the sustainable rate, raising questions about how selfish behavior—and punishment to deter it—affect the system’s productivity.

_Emergence_: Key outcomes of this model are the total number of cooperative and selfish harvesters, their spatial arrangement (are they mixed together or isolated?), and the total harvest, which can be considered a measure of the whole system’s productivity. These outcomes emerge from the rate of resource production and the methods by which the two kinds of harvesters decide how much resource to harvest. Because harvesters can move, these results also emerge in part from the spatial distribution of resources and how harvesters decide when and where to resettle. The degree of greediness among selfish harvesters also emerges from model mechanisms. When selfish harvesters reproduce they produce new selfish harvesters that inherit the parent’s value of _greediness_. More successful harvesters are more likely to reproduce, so _greediness_ is actually subject to “evolution” in the population.


_Adaptation_: The model includes two kinds of adaptive behavior by harvesters, although the first is not represented explicitly as a decision. This first adaptation is adjusting harvest to the amount of resource available in the patch (the harvest submodel): cooperative harvesters adjust their harvest so that, if only cooperative harvesters occupied the patch, maximum sustained yield would be obtained. Selfish harvesters adapt to resource availability by using the harvest rule that provides highest harvest.
The second adaptive behavior is deciding to resettle in a new patch if harvest is unsatisfactory (the resettlement submodel). The decision of whether to resettle is stochastic, but the choice of a new patch is made to maximize a specific objective. 

_Objectives_: When harvesters resettle, they select the patch, among the available alternatives, with highest current value of _resource_. It is important to understand this objective does not clearly maximize the harvester’s future harvest, energy level, reproductive output, etc. For example, a patch may have highest resource availability because it has a low resource production rate and is therefore occupied by few or no harvesters, while the most productive patches are already occupied by harvesters that consume all their resources. A productive patch could also not provide high future harvest if multiple harvesters move into it.

_Learning_: The model includes no learning.

_Prediction_: Harvesters do not use explicit prediction in their adaptive behaviors. However, the objective used in the resettlement behaviors is based on the implicit prediction that the patch with currently high resource will provide high harvest in the future. As discussed above, this prediction could often be wrong.

_Sensing_: The harvest obtained by each harvester depends on how many others are in the patch (the harvest submodel), so harvesters are assumed to sense how many harvesters are in their patch. The resettlement submodel assumes harvesters know which surrounding patch has the highest value of _resource_.

_Interaction_: The harvesters interact with each other indirectly via competition for their patch’s resource. Punishment is often a type of interaction, in that a society imposes the punishment on an individual. However, in this model punishment is not clearly represented as an interaction; e.g., fines imposed on selfish harvesters are not made available to others.

_Stochasticity_: The model landscape is created by drawing each patch’s value of _max-resource_ from a random distribution. This approach is used because variability among patches in resource production is considered important, but the amount and characteristics of this variability need to be controlled. Alternative distributions (uniform, normal, and exponential) are used to represent different types of variability among patches. There is no spatial correlation in _max-resource_: each patch’s value is independent of the value of adjacent patches. The punishment, resettlement, and reproduction submodels are each partially stochastic, as a way of inducing variability and controlling the rate of punishment, movement, and reproduction. 

_Collectives_: The harvesters on a patch could be thought of as a simple collective because they intentionally share its resources. However, the model does not treat patches explicitly as collectives. 

_Observation_: Key results are the total number of cooperative and selfish harvesters, their spatial arrangement, and the total harvest. The total numbers of cooperative and selfish harvesters are plotted over time. Their spatial arrangement is displayed visually via the NetLogo View, with patches shaded by _max-resource_ and harvesters colored by behavior type. The production of resource (increase in _resource_, in the resource growth submodel) is observed via file output of the total production over all patches, on each time step. Harvest of resource is observed by file output of the total harvest, summed over all harvesters, at the end of each time step.  

## INITIALIZATION
### Landscape and patches
Initialization begins by setting the value of _max-resource_ of each patch. The user selects one of four optional distributions of this variable, with the distribution treated as a model parameter. Upon initialization, the value of _max-resource_ for each patch is drawn randomly from the selected distribution. For all four distributions, the mean of _max-resource_ is a model parameter _max-resource-mean_, which has a standard value of 100 energy units. The four alternative distributions are:

  * Homogeneous landscape: all patches have _max-resource_ equal to _max-resource-mean_.
  * Uniform: _max-resource_ is drawn from a uniform distribution with minimum of 0.5 _max-resource-mean_ and maximum of 1.5 _max-resource-mean_.
  * Normal: _max-resource_ is drawn from a normal distribution with mean of _max-resource-mean_ and standard deviation of 1/3 _max-resource-mean_.
  * Exponential: _max-resource_ is drawn from an exponential distribution with mean of _max-resource-mean_. (Exponential distributions have few high values and many low values.)

Next, the patches’ value of _resource_ must be initialized; it is arbitrarily set to half of _max-resource_.

### Harvesters
Simulations start with 5000 initial harvesters, which have their state variables initialized in these ways:

  * Location is set by moving the harvester to a randomly selected patch.
  * Behavior-type is assigned randomly to either “cooperative” or “selfish”, with equal probability of each type.
  * For selfish harvesters, the value of greediness is drawn randomly from a uniform distribution between 0.0 and 1.0.
  * Energy is set to 10 energy units.

## INPUT DATA
No time-series input data are used.

## SUBMODELS

### Resource growth
Resource growth is modeled using a simple logistic model, which assumes the amount of resource produced in a time step increases and then decreases as resource increases. The equation for updating _resource_ is:
_resource_ = _prev-resource_ + ( _growth-rate_ × _prev-resource_ × (1 – ( _prev-resource_ / _max-resource_ )))
where _resource_ is the value of _resource_ in the current time step, _prev-resource_ is the value of _resource_ after being updated in this submodel the previous time step minus the total harvest by all harvesters in patch during the previous time step, and _growth-rate_ is a parameter with value of 0.075.
   
### Harvest
The harvest submodel updates a harvester’s value of the state variables harvest and energy. 

Cooperative harvesters (with _behavior-type_ = “cooperative”) are assumed to harvest the amount that each occupant of a patch would get if each got an equal share of the “maximum sustainable yield” (MSY) of the resource. MSY is the harvest rate that maximizes long-term resource production and harvest, and can be shown mathematically to equal ( _max-resource_ × _growth-rate_ ) / 8 for the logistic model of resource growth. Therefore, the harvest of a cooperative harvester is equal to a variable _cooperative-harvest_ = MSY / _num-harvesters_ where _num-harvesters_ is the number of all harvesters on the patch. The value of _harvest_ for cooperative harvesters is set to _cooperative-harvest_.

Selfish harvesters are assumed to desire a higher harvest, the variable _selfish-harvest_, which is equal to _maintenance-energy_ × (1 + _greediness_). _Maintenance-energy_ is a harvester parameter representing a harvester’s energy requirement per time step, with value of 0.3 energy units. However, _selfish-harvest_ may sometimes be less than _cooperative-harvest_, so for selfish harvesters, _harvest_ is set to the highest of _selfish-harvest_ and _cooperative-harvest_.
 
For all harvesters, the value of _energy_ is updated by adding _harvest_ to it.

### Punishment
This harvester submodel determines whether energy is lost due to punishment for selfish harvesting. A variable _fine_ represents the energy lost this way. The parameter _punishment-probability_ is the risk of being punished for harvesting more than cooperative harvesters do. If the value of _harvest_ was higher than the value of _cooperative-harvest_ in the harvest submodel, punishment is simulated as a stochastic event with probability _punishment-probability_ of occurring. _Punishment-probability_ is a key model parameter because examining the effect of punishment is a main purpose of the model; the parameter’s standard value is 0.2. If punishment occurs, then the value of _fine_ is two times the amount by which harvest exceeded _cooperative-harvest_.

The value of _fine_ is subtracted from the harvester’s value of _energy_.

### Resettlement
This submodel is executed by each “dissatisfied” harvester: those whose value of _harvest_, for the current time step, was less than desired. For cooperative harvesters, the desired harvest is the minimum energy need, equal to the parameter _maintenance-energy_. For selfish harvesters, the desired harvest is the value of _selfish-harvest_ calculated in the harvest submodel.

Each dissatisfied harvester has a probability of 0.5 of moving to the neighboring patch (one of the eight surrounding patches) with highest current value of _resource_. When a harvester moves, none of its state variables change except its location and energy; _energy_ is reduced by the cost moving. This cost is the parameter _move-cost_, with a value of 0.6 energy units.

### Death
This submodel represents the maintenance energy costs of harvesters and their death due to lack of energy. Maintenance costs are represented by the parameter _maintenance-energy_. The value of _energy_ is updated by subtracting _maintenance-energy_. If the result is less than or equal to zero, the harvester immediately dies and is removed from the simulation.

### Reproduction
This submodel determines whether a harvester creates an offspring and, if so, creates the new harvester. Reproducing is a stochastic event with probability increasing with the harvester’s energy. The probability of reproducing is equal to 0.0003 × _energy_.

When a harvester produces an offspring, its value of _energy_ is reduced by half. The offspring is a new harvester created immediately, with state variables set as follows:

  * Location is set by moving the new harvester to the patch with highest value of _resource_, within a radius of 5 patches.
  * _Energy_ is set to its parent’s value (which is half the parent’s pre-reproduction energy).
  * All other state variables, including _greediness_, are set to the parent’s value.
